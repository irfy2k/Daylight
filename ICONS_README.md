# Icon Files Needed

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create these PNG icon files in the `public` folder:

## Required Icons:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)  
3. **apple-touch-icon.png** (180x180 pixels)

## How to Create:

1. Use the `icon.svg` file I created as a base
2. Convert it to PNG at the required sizes using:
   - Online converter like https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
   - Design tool like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
   - Command line tool like ImageMagick

## Design:
- Black background (#000000)
- White sun icon in center
- Minimalist design matching the app theme

## Alternative:
You can also use a simple favicon generator tool like https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/ with:
- Text: "D" (for Daylight)
- Background: Black
- Text Color: White
- Font: Monospace

The app is now configured for PWA installation with proper manifest and meta tags!
